# Chatbot_Energy_Consumption_LEAP
Developed an AI-driven chatbot for La Trobe University's Bundoora campus to provide summarized insights and visualizations of energy consumption data, and predict future usage patterns.

Collecting and Understanding Data:

•	The first phase involves gathering energy consumption data from La Trobe Engergy Analytics Platform (LEAP) and within the university. This data might include historical energy usage records, weather data, occupancy information, and other relevant metrics.

•	Understanding the data involves identifying the structure, types, and patterns inherent in the dataset. This step is critical for informing the subsequent stages of data pre-processing and analysis.

Data Pre-processing and Exploration:

•	Data pre-processing entails cleaning the collected data to remove any inaccuracies or inconsistencies. This might involve handling missing values, normalizing data, and correcting any errors.

•	Analysis of the pre-processed data involves applying statistical methods to uncover insights and trends. This stage aims to extract meaningful information that will inform the development of the chatbot's summarization and prediction capabilities.

Predictive Models:

•	Implementing predictive models is critical for forecasting future energy usage. Machine learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and others, will be trained on historical data from LEAP. These models will undergo rigorous tuning and validation to optimize predictive performance and enhance accuracy.

Building Algorithms:

•	The development of algorithms is at the heart of the chatbot's functionality. For summarization and visualization, algorithms will be designed to process and present data in a user-friendly manner.

•	For prediction, machine learning models will be trained on historical data to forecast future energy usage. This involves selecting appropriate models, training them, and tuning their parameters to achieve the best predictive performance.
